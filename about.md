# All about the work:

Hey, may name is Max.
I am a 18 year old intern at the software company Crate based in Dornbirn, Austria.

In the upcoming 6 weeks i will post small blog posts about my experience, work and things I have learned at Crate. If you are interested in the workflow, corporate culture or the life of an intern at such a company then this is the perfect blog for you.
