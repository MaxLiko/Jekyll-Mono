Week3: Front- Backend development and my first completed Sprint. 

## Front- and Backend-Madness
-----

Most of the week was dedicated to working, developing and the integration of a front and backend design of an app. 
To be specific the [example app](https://github.com/crate/crate-sample-apps) of Crate.
But lets start at the beginning of the week.

As every Monday, this one was fantastic as it was again dedicated to team-cooking and as such a day fantastic in it self. 
I ate to many hot dogs and was afterwards nearly to full to work again :) .

Than it was time to start with one of the sample apps for Crate. 
I choose the python one as it was suggested by a few people do to the fact that python is quite easy to learn and in a lot of applications used. 
After a few hours of python tutorials and several self prepared code-challenges (e.g.. The Game Of Life) if felt confident enough to tackle the application code. 
After a small coding session where Joe showed me the most important parts of the code and a lot of try & error and a lot of internet research I finally managed to get my own version running. 
But it has still a few problems which need to be taken care of (WIP as always ;) ). 

After this task was finished I switched from the back to the front of the application and the new programming languages I had to deal with were css, html and java script. 
As I am writing this on Thursday I am not quite finished with adapting the existing fronted design to the existing application I will report at a later point in time again.

This week was especially hard as i had to work with a lot of new stuff. 
But this was also an opportunity as I had to read about a lot of related stuff and try a lot things.
